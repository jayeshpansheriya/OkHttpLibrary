Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of. For this purpose Gson provides several built in serializers and deserializers. A serializer allows to convert a Json string to corresponding Java type and a deserializers allows to convert from Java to a JSON representation. You can also configure Gson to use custom representations of your objects.
